Our system consists of a text understanding module, a high-level planning module and a scene generator. The user can input a screenplay as a set of well-formed English sentences via a graphic user interface. The text understanding module interprets the input sentences and triggers the high-level planner to construct a plan of actions for the appropriate agents. Then the agents execute the plans, and the scene generator renders the scene as the story evolves. Our system provides the user with a powerful tool to visualize his screenplays (stories) in the form of computer graphics, which makes writing story fun for students as well as for screenplay writers."

Stories that are told are often flexible in these respects: the storyteller can change order and content in response to the audience reaction and participation. Interactive multimedia and digital storytelling technologies now make the presentation of interactive stories possible, with non-linear narrative flow and dynamic character definitions and developments. Authoring such interactive stories has thus become a new challenge for authors and artists. We report on the development and initial tests of a prototype authoring support tool that is intended to support authors in the design, construction and specification of Digital Interactive Stories for multimedia presentation platforms. This Authoring Tool is part of the art-E-fact project- a collaborative project funded by the EU- in which it serves as an experimental platform for understanding how artists and authors want to create these new kinds of 'Digital Stories'."

We provide simple feedback to the user detailing the most and least readable sentences, the sentences most densely packed with information and the most cohesive words in their document.

Users can modify or delete suggestions according to their own vision of the unfolding narrative. The application tracks users‚Äô changes to suggestions in order to measure their perceived helpfulness to the story, with fewer edits indicating more helpful suggestions. We demonstrate how the edit distance between a suggestion and its resulting modification can be used to comparatively evaluate different models for generating suggestions. We describe a generation model that uses case-based reasoning to find relevant suggestions from a large corpus of stories. The application shows that this model generates suggestions that are more helpful than randomly selected suggestions at a level of marginal statistical significance. By giving users control over the generated content, Creative Help provides a new opportunity in open-domain interactive storytelling."

We considered that the methodology in this work was fairly complex, but our results show ‚Äì through a data triangulation approach ‚Äì that we were able to identify more consistent and personal creative experiences. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is a new paradigm for designing VR user interfaces targeted at stimulating creativity by showing that a ""one-illusion interspace"" leads to a greater self-perception of creativity."

Tropes, which are recurring narrative elements across stories, are essential in stories as they shape the structure of narratives and our understanding of them. In this paper, we propose to use tropes as an intermediate representation of stories to approach story ideation. We present TaleStream, a canvas system that uses tropes as building blocks of stories while providing steerable suggestions of story ideas in the form of tropes. Our trope suggestion methods leverage data from the tvtropes.org wiki. We find that 97\% of the time, trope suggestions generated by our methods provide better story ideation materials than random tropes.
